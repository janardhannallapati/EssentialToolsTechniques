When you're loading external libraries, having to type out the full classpath can be burdensome.
You can instead change to the current directory of where all your external libraries are located 
and start jshell from that directory, utilizing an asterisk (surrounded by quotes) to include all
jars. This works on all OSes.

$ jshell --class-path "*"

The same command also works with paths. This also works on all OSes.

$ jshell --class-path "libs/*"

if you've already typed a number of commands but forgot to set the classpath when you started 
JShell, you can also utilize the /env command to set the classpath.

jshell> /env --class-path foo.jar
